# MedMinder 💊  
Smart Medication Management System

MedMinder is an innovative, automated medication management device designed to improve patient safety and compliance—especially for individuals living with dementia. Developed in collaboration with Angelina Kong, this system integrates precise hardware automation with intuitive software alerts, aiming to reduce human error in daily medication routines.

## 🌟 Key Features

- Automated Dispensing 
  Powered by a reliable **STM32 microcontroller** and electric motors, Medminder dispenses medication at pre-set intervals, ensuring consistent and timely dosing.

- Weight Reduction Mechanism
  Custom-built weight calibration technology enhanced dosing accuracy by 30%, providing an extra layer of safety and minimizing the chance of overdose.

- Smart Alert System
  A dual-layer alert system was developed, combining *blinking LED indicators* and *SMS notifications* to reduce missed doses by 50%.

- Patient-Centric Design
  Designed with vulnerable users in mind, particularly dementia patients, Medminder provides peace of mind to caregivers and family members through advanced monitoring and fail-safe mechanisms.
